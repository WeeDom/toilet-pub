# 🚽 Toilet AI Project Summary — Prompt for Tomorrow

You’re working on an AI project to:

> **Detect whether a public toilet has been vandalised or if an object (e.g., handbag) has just been left behind.**

## ✅ Current Goals
- Classify **toilet images** into:
  - “normal with object left behind” (e.g. handbag)
  - “vandalised” (e.g. broken seat, mess)
- Eventually run this inference on a **robot or automated camera**

---

## 🧠 Current Status (As of Now)

### 🚧 Progress So Far:
- 🧠 AI model direction: likely to use **YOLOv8** for image classification or detection
- 💻 AWS `g4dn.large` GPU instance is ready for training/inference
- 💬 Discussion of tools:
  - FiftyOne: powerful but too heavy for your dev laptop
  - PyTorch + Ultralytics: chosen stack
  - EC2 setup: almost done
- 💸 Awareness of GPU billing: instance billed on uptime, **not GPU usage**

### ⏸️ Paused for:
- Feedback from **councillors / DPO / ICO**
- Privacy and ethical review before further image processing

---

## ⚙️ Ready to Resume Tasks
When you return:
1. Boot the EC2 `g4dn.large` instance
2. Use the fast setup steps to:
   - Install `conda`, `torch`, and `ultralytics`
   - Test YOLOv8 on a sample image
3. Optionally upload your toilet image dataset to the instance
4. Begin classification prototype: object left vs damage

I (or another instance) can help you:
- Write the training pipeline
- Fine-tune YOLO
- Create a Docker image (optional)
- Automate AWS lifecycle (auto-shutdown etc.)

---

## ⏱ Time-Sensitive Tip
Once you're ready to run a model:
- Keep EC2 runtime **short**
- Use `sudo shutdown now` or AWS Console to **stop the instance** immediately after testing
