# Story 4.3: Multi-Camera Management & Store-Forward

**Epic:** 4 - Edge Controller (Raspberry Pi)
**Status:** ❌ TODO

## Description
Implement comprehensive multi-camera management on the Raspberry Pi, including device lifecycle management, load balancing, priority queuing, and store-and-forward capability for handling intermittent internet connectivity.

## Goals
- Manage 10+ cameras per Pi gateway
- Store-and-forward queue for EC2 uploads during offline periods
- Priority queuing (motion events > heartbeats)
- Load balancing across cameras
- Automatic failover for redundant coverage zones
- Local storage with automatic cleanup

## Key Components
- Camera pool manager (registration, health tracking)
- Event queue with priorities (high/medium/low)
- Store-forward buffer (SQLite or filesystem)
- Bandwidth throttling and QoS
- Local storage manager (retention policies)
- Sync engine for EC2 uploads

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manages 10+ ESP32-CAM devices concurrently
- [ ] Store-forward queue holds 1000+ events
- [ ] Priority events uploaded first when connectivity restored
- [ ] Local storage capped at 10GB with auto-cleanup
- [ ] Bandwidth throttling prevents network saturation
- [ ] Camera health monitoring and auto-recovery
- [ ] Sync to EC2 resumes automatically after outage

## Dependencies
- Story 4.2 (ESP32-CAM Integration)
- Story 3.3 (Heartbeat protocol)
- Story 5.1 (Central API)
- SQLite for queue management
