# Story 7.1: Performance Benchmarking

**Epic:** 7 - System Validation
**Status:** ❌ TODO

## Description
Conduct comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking of all system components to validate performance targets, identify bottlenecks, and establish baseline metrics for production monitoring.

## Goals
- Validate motion detection FPS targets
- Measure power consumption (ESP32, ESP8266, Pi)
- Test system under load (100+ devices)
- Measure latency (detection → alert)
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Establish SLA baselines

## Test Scenarios
1. **Motion Detection FPS**
   - Target: 10 FPS minimum
   - Test with 1, 4, 10 cameras simultaneously
   - Measure CPU/memory usage

2. **Power Consumption**
   - ESP32-CAM: Idle, streaming, motion detection
   - ESP8266 PIR: Active, sleep mode
   - Pi: Various camera counts
   - Target: ESP8266 3-6 months on battery

3. **Network Performance**
   - Bandwidth per camera
   - Packet loss tolerance
   - Latency measurements

4. **End-to-End Latency**
   - PIR detection → Camera disable: <500ms
   - Motion event → Dashboard alert: <2s
   - Image upload → S3 storage: <10s

5. **Scale Testing**
   - 100 devices per Pi
   - 1000 devices system-wide
   - Load testing API endpoints

## Key Metrics
- FPS per camera
- Power consumption (mA)
- Network bandwidth (Mbps)
- Latency (ms)
- CPU/memory usage (%)
- Uptime (days)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Motion detection ≥10 FPS per camera
- [ ] ESP8266 battery life ≥90 days
- [ ] PIR → camera disable latency <500ms
- [ ] Motion event → alert latency <2s
- [ ] Pi handles 10 cameras at <70% CPU
- [ ] System handles 100 devices without degradation
- [ ] Network bandwidth <1 Mbps per camera
- [ ] Benchmark report published
- [ ] Performance regression tests automated

## Dependencies
- All previous stories (full system required)
- Test lab (Story 1.6)
- Load testing tools (Locust, JMeter)
