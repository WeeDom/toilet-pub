# Story 7.2: Multi-Device Field Testing

**Epic:** 7 - System Validation
**Status:** ❌ TODO

## Description
Deploy a complete Guard-e-loo system in a real-world test environment (friendly restaurant or council facility) with multiple cameras, PIR sensors, and full Pi/EC2 infrastructure. Run for 30+ days to validate reliability and identify real-world issues.

## Goals
- Real-world deployment with actual users
- 30-day continuous operation test
- Validate privacy protection effectiveness
- Test edge cases and failure modes
- Gather user feedback
- Measure system reliability (uptime, MTBF)

## Test Site Requirements
- 2-4 toilet stalls
- WiFi coverage
- Power outlets
- Permission from facility owner
- Privacy compliance approval

## Test Configuration
- 3-4 ESP32-CAM devices
- 4-6 PIR sensors (primary + backup)
- 1 Raspberry Pi gateway
- EC2 backend connection
- Full encryption enabled
- Dashboard monitoring

## Test Scenarios
1. **Normal Operation**
   - Monitor occupancy patterns
   - Verify camera disable/enable
   - Check image quality

2. **Failure Modes**
   - WiFi dropout simulation
   - Power loss recovery
   - Sensor failure handling
   - Pi gateway offline

3. **Edge Cases**
   - High traffic periods
   - Overnight low usage
   - Multiple simultaneous occupants
   - Extended occupancy (accessible stalls)

4. **Privacy Validation**
   - Confirm cameras disable on occupancy
   - Verify no images captured when disabled
   - Test manual override safeguards

## Metrics to Track
- System uptime (target: 99.9%)
- False positive rate (<1%)
- False negative rate (<0.1%)
- Privacy violations (target: 0)
- Average response time
- Device failure rate
- User satisfaction

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 30-day continuous operation achieved
- [ ] System uptime ≥99.5%
- [ ] Zero privacy violations
- [ ] False positive rate <1%
- [ ] All device failures detected and alerted
- [ ] User feedback collected (5+ users)
- [ ] Issue log documented
- [ ] Lessons learned report
- [ ] Production readiness checklist complete

## Dependencies
- All previous stories (complete system)
- Test site partner agreement
- Liability insurance
- GDPR compliance approval
