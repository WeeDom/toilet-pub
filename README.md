# Guard-e-Loo Document Repo

This private repository tracks the evolution of the Guard-e-Loo project,
including patent claims, abstracts, diagrams, sales pitches, and branding work.

## Structure
- `docs/patents/` – Claims, abstracts, diagrams, notes.
- `docs/pitches/` – Sales and investor pitch material.
- `docs/brand/` – Naming, trademark checks, taglines.
- `docs/legal/` – Filing strategies, classes, correspondence.

## Usage
- Draft in Markdown for clean diffs.
- Commit often with clear messages.
- Use dated filenames for versions.
- Share PDFs/Word versions externally (but don’t overwrite the repo source).

## Note
This repo may serve as evidence of invention dates (defensive publication).
Keep it private unless/ until you’re ready to disclose.
